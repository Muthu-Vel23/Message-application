# Message-application
This is a simple Node.js web application that allows users to post and view messages on a message board. Messages are stored in a JSON file, displayed dynamically on the homepage, and can be cleared. The app uses a separate HTML file for the frontend, with clean styling and basic routing handled by Node.js.
